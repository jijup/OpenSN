\section{Introduction}

Write about procedural noise, motivations and applications~\cite{ahlvers2005model}

Discuss the axial correlation of Perlin noise, how better gradient overcomes this limitation. Briefly mention about other noise such as wavelet, Gabor, anisotropics etc..Cite the survey as well.

Discuss pairing functions-mention Cantor and Szudzik etc..What makes them a better hasg=hing function Not in detail. Somehow relate pairing functions to hashing.\\

Outline the contributions:\\
-Pairing functions for hashing
-Probably a different noise function?
-Computational improvements?
